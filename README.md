## üåê System Architecture

This project follows a client-server architecture. The frontend, built with React, communicates with a Node.js backend. This backend uses Socket.io to manage real-time communication for chat and Y-Websocket for collaborative editing. The server interacts with a **MongoDB** database to persist data and an external compiler API to execute code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies
    npm install
    # Assuming your frontend is in a 'frontend' folder
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create `.env` files for both your root directory and `frontend` directory based on the provided `.env.example` files. You will need to add your MongoDB connection string and compiler API key to these files.

    **Example `.env` (root):**
    ```
    PORT=3001
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JDOODLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    JDOODLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    ```

    **Example `.env` (frontend):**
    ```
    VITE_REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001
    VITE_REACT_APP_YWS_URL=ws://localhost:3001/yws
    VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    # Start the backend server
    npm start

    # Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the client
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if configured) and the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.
